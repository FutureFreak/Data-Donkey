Data-Donkey
===========

Account execs in agencies always want to know how their latest campaign is doing - how many people have entered, today, in total, how many have signed up for the newsletter etc. This request usually comes at the point that we're busy doing something else.

Data-Donkey was created to give them simple (aka restricted) access to the data that they usually ask us to pull for them.  Leaving us to work happily on our real work. Let Data-Donkey do all the work for us (you see what we've done there!) :)
